### Rules for Hashmaps ###
1. Scrambled deterministically
2. Fixed size output
3. Irreversible


### SHA-256 ###
1. Fixed length of 256 bits (unique to SHA-256, other hash functions don't usually match up in name and length.)
2. Secure (better than SHA-1 and MD5 which are insecure due to hash collissions "fingerprint spoofing")
3. Fast (bad for user acccounts and databases as it doesn't prevent brute force well)
